# Customizable Visual Sign

This projects allows you to write your own custom message on a LCD display. The visual display consists of scrolling letters and colorful LEDS. Plus the display can be controlled by a remote controller!

## Materials

- Breadboard
- 2 LEDS
- 1 220ohm resistors
- Arduino Uno
- I2C LCD display
- IR sensor
- Joystick
- Push Button
- Around 20 - 30 jumper wires

## Schematic (excluding LCD and Joystick)

The CAD I was using didn't have the LCD (I2C) and Joystick. Wiring those two components should be pretty simple as long as you look over the source code.

## How It Works

Since this project contains many components, I will describe the functionalties of each component individually.

### Push Button Mechanism

### IR Sensor

### LCD Display Functionality

### JoyStick
